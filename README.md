# Real-Time Collaborative Note Editor (Like Google Docs)

The UI will be as plain as possible.
First version will not include a user auth system.
All the docs will be retrievable by everyone

Below is a draft that I came up with. It includes my goals with the project.

### Features:

- [x] Real-time collaborative editing.
- [x] Document versioning and history.
- [ ] Conflict resolution and merging.
- [ ] User presence and activity indicators.
- [x] WebSocket-based communication for real-time updates.
- [ ] Document ownership
- [ ] Encryption for the docs
- [ ] Better storage for docs (file based probably)
- [ ] Better UI
- [ ] Homepage
