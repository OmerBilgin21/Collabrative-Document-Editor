# Real-Time Collaborative Document Editor (Google Docs Clone)

The UI will be as plain as possible.
First version will not include a user auth system.
All the docs will be retrievable by everyone

Below is a draft that I came up with. It includes my goals with the project.

Features:

-   Real-time collaborative editing.
-   Document versioning and history.
-   Conflict resolution and merging.
-   User presence and activity indicators.
-   WebSocket-based communication for real-time updates.
