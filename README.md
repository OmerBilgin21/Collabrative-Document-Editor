# Real-Time Collaborative Note Editor (Like Google Docs)

The UI will be as plain as possible.
First version will not include a user auth system.
All the docs will be retrievable by everyone

Below is a draft that I came up with. It includes my goals with the project.

Features:

- Real-time collaborative editing.
- Document versioning and history.
- Conflict resolution and merging.
- User presence and activity indicators.
- WebSocket-based communication for real-time updates.
